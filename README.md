Data Modeling Project

This repository contains a data model focusing on key database design concepts such as entity relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and various types of relationships between entities.

Project Overview
In this project, I worked on:

Entity Relationships: Defining entities and how they relate to one another.
Primary Keys: Assigning unique identifiers to entities to ensure data integrity.
Foreign Keys: Establishing connections between related entities by referencing primary keys from other tables.
One-to-One Relationships: Demonstrating how two entities can relate with a unique pair connection.
One-to-Many Relationships: Modeling how a single entity can relate to multiple entities in another table.

How to Use
You can explore the repository to see the ER diagrams and SQL scripts that demonstrate these concepts. Each section focuses on different aspects of data modeling and the relationships between entities.
